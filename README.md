## SUMMARY
### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code
Refactoring helps to maintain a code and make it clean and organized. It helps to find bugs and make programs run faster
The disadvantage of code refactoring is that it is time consuming and can result in complexity.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Afer refactoring the original VBA script, the code's overall design is improved and organized. For instance, in the refactored code, the year input value allows to run the code for required years without having to run the entire code again.
However, the refactored code may be difficult to understand as it's functionality remains same.
